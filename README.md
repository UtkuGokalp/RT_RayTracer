<h1>What is this project</h1>
This project is a renderer that utilizes real time ray tracing capabilities provided by DXR component of DirectX12.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
In order for this project to work, you need DirectX12 and Windows SDK 10.0.18362.0 installed on your computer. You will also need Visual Studio 2022. Other versions will probably work fine as well but they are not tested. Finally, you will need a graphics card that supports DXR. At the time of writing, this means you need a GPU from one of the following:
<ul>
    <li>AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series</li>
    <li>AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series</li>
    <li>NVIDIA GeForce 20 Series</li>
