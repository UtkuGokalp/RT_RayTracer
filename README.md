<h1>What is this project</h1>
This project is a real time ray tracer that uses DirectX12 Ultimate and DXR API to achieve real time ray tracing.

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
You need to be on at least Windows 10 version 1903 to be able to run this project since that is the lowest Windows version that supports DirectX12 Ultimate and DXR. You also need Visual Studio 2022 or above. Older versions might work but they are not tested. Finally, you will need a graphics card that supports DXR. At the time of writing, this means you need a GPU from one of the following:
<ul>
    <li>AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series or above</li>
    <li>NVIDIA RTX 20 Series or above</li>
    <li>Any Intel Arc GPU</li>
</ul>
